## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Favicon (Favorite Icon)
Small icon that appears in browser tabs and bookmarks. You have:
- **favicon.ico** for browsers that still use ICO format
- **favicon-32x32.png** for modern browsers (preferred)

### Web App Manifest
JSON file that makes your website installable as an app. Includes:
- App name and description
- Icons in multiple sizes
- Theme colors
- Display mode (standalone = app-like experience)

### PWA (Progressive Web App)
A web app that works like a native app. Your setup enables:
- Installation as desktop/mobile app
- Offline capability (with service worker)
- Standalone mode (no browser UI)
- Home screen icon

### Meta Tags
HTML tags in `<head>` that provide metadata:
- **Open Graph** - Facebook/LinkedIn sharing preview
- **Twitter Card** - Twitter sharing preview
- **theme-color** - Browser address bar color
- **SEO** - Page title, description, keywords
